Lesson 2 in "Real World Windows 10 Development (2nd Ed.) *by Edward and Elizabeth Moemeka*

Kudos to Edward and Elizabeth for writing what is, without a doubt, the best "Learn to Program in Windows 10" book that I've seen.

There are more than just a few changes in the **Windows** application softare development paradigm<sup>1</sup> and This book is at once Logical, Practical, and so well planned that it is, actually, easy to follow.  In spite of these characteristics, it is also a fun, but even more, an exciting book that I eagerly pick up and work from morning after morning.<sup>2</sup>

<sup>[1]"Paradigm", is bandied about such that out eyes glaze over when it arrives, but, when you consider the many changes in Windows 10 Application Development, it really does feel justified to use *paradigm* yet one more time.</sup>

<sup>[2]It occurs to me that this needs a qualifier, because when I see this kind of sweet, sappy rheteric, I imagine that it's written by the author's brother's wife, and then I usually roll my eyes and fast-forward to the closing compliment.  My wife says I'm a cynic and guess she's probably right about that, because now I should have cause to reconcider stance because not only do Edward and Elizabeth not know who I am, I'd never know their names but for this wonderful book.  I just want to write it down because I'd been wanting to learn UWP programming for some time before picking up "Real World Windows 10 Development" (needs an acronym), and am very pleased and even thankful because their book really is taking the mystery out of Windows 10 Application Development.</sup>
