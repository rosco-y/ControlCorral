Lesson 2 in "Real World Windows 10 Development (2nd Ed.) *by Edward and Elizabeth Moemeka*

Kudos to Edward and Elizabeth for writing what is, without a doubt, the best "Learn to Program in Windows 10" book that I've seen.

There are more than just a few changes in the **Windows** application softare development paradigm<sup>1</sup> and This book is at once Logical, Practical, and so well planned that it is, actually, easy to follow.  In spite of these characteristics, it is also a fun, but even more, an exciting book that I eagerly pick up and work from morning after morning.

The turns in software licensing programs are making this a very exciting time to be a software developer.  Visual Studio, which used to run thousands of dollars per year is now essentially free if you promise not to make any money with it.  Git is also virtually free, and as a file repository is another resource that has me shaking my head at my good fortune.  Last but not Least, Even Microsoft Windows is essentially free in the sense that once you own the license for a very affordable $100.00, you have free Windows Updates into perpetuity.

So given that I have a modest investment in hardware, (a bargain Dell PC:3.20GHz Intel Pentium CPU; 1TB HD; 16 GB RAM and a couple of flat-panel displays (I would enjoy a nice Graphics Card, but my on-board Intel Display Adapters do the bulk of the work  without hickups--I do see some problems displaying my web-link menus in my web browser when the menus get nested more than a few levels deep.)

<sup>[1]"Paradigm", is bandied about such that out eyes glaze over when it arrives, but, when I consider the many changes in Windows 10 Application Development, it really does feel justified to use *paradigm* yet one more time.</sup>
