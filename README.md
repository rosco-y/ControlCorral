Lesson 2 in "Real World Windows 10 Development (2nd Ed.) *by Edward and Elizabeth Moemeka*

Kudos to Edward and Elizabeth for writing what is, without a doubt, the best "Learn to Program in Windows 10" book that I've seen.

There are more than just a few changes in the **Windows** application softare development paradigm<sup>1</sup> and This book is at once Logical, Practical, and well mapped making it easy to follow.  In spite of these characteristics, it is also afun, nea, **exciting**, tome, and I eagerly pick it up and work from it morning after morning.

<sup>[1]"Paradigm", is bandied about such that out eyes glaze over when it arrives, but, when you consider the many changes in Windows 10 Application Development, it really does feel justified to use paradigm yet one more time.</sup>
